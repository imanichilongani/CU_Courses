# OneSpot
Script that scrapes Cornell's student center and returns number of open spots in a particular course
Run script from command line using the following command: python cu_courses.py
You need to have Chrome browser as well as ChromeDrive installed inorder for script to work. 
Note: This is my first side project, and I know it's not the best looking code. Since I developed this I have learnt a lot more about programming and gained more experience.
